I want you to make the mock results more custom. II'm going to provide a content breakdown for you. Use it to create the mock results. Reference the content details in every section so that it's obvious the analysis is based on the content:

0:00 - 0:03 (Hook - Instant Chaos)

Quick shot of you approaching a random dad holding his daughter at the mall.

Without hesitation, you pretend to start trimming the little girl’s hair mid-step.

The dad instantly gets visibly angry, handing the daughter to her mom behind him like he's ready to square up.

Super fast cuts and zoom-ins, dramatic heartbeat SFX, red tint flashes on the dad’s face — like it’s about to go down.

Edit Tip: Use the “record scratch + freeze frame” sound effect, freeze the frame on the dad’s angry face and pop up some humorous text:

“How we almost got kicked out the mall for doing too much 😅”

0:04 - 0:07 (Tension Builds, But Flips)

You raise your hands, backing away with a calm face.

Cut to a subtitle overlay of you saying:

“Bro, hear me out. Your daughter’s hair is royalty… it deserves a crown treatment.”

The dad smirks. Music shifts from intense to chill.

Edit Tip: Use a trending audio that transitions from suspense to something soft and melodic — like a remix of SZA’s "Good Days” or a slowed version of “Calm Down” by Rema.

0:08 - 0:15 (Barbershop Transition)

Seamlessly cut from the mall to your barbershop.

Use a whip-pan transition with a “pop!” sound to enter the salon.

Inside, the girl is in the chair, cape on, looking cute but messy.

Edit Tip: Use B-roll overlays of your tools, the clippers buzzing in slow-mo, hair falling dramatically in 120fps. Add quick titles on screen like:

“Tangles? No Problem.”

“Curls? Royalty Treatment.”

0:16 - 0:22 (The Glow Up)

Montage edit of the haircut: you combing, snipping, moisturizing curls, gently styling.

Overlay with trending sound that celebrates glow-ups — possibly “Made You Look” by Meghan Trainor (sped up) or “Barbie World” by Nicki & Ice Spice (clean edit).

Edit Tip: Add reactions from the parents — dad nodding, mom smiling, kid giggling in slow-mo.

0:23 - 0:27 (The Reveal)

Before/After Slide — split-screen of her in the mall looking wild vs. sitting in the chair looking like a princess.

Add a sparkle effect ✨ or “heaven light” animation.

Caption idea:

“Every princess deserves her crown 👑✨ #RoyalTrim”
