Concept Analysis (70% of Virality Score) â€“ Identifying Viral Potential
Step 1.1: Trend Alignment (15%)
Agents & Models:
Trend Detection Agent â†’ Gemini 1.5 Flash (models/gemini-1.5-flash-8b-001)
Fetches real-time trend data from social platforms (X, TikTok, Instagram).
Classifies content type (e.g., Skits, Challenges, Storytelling).
Assesses trend lifespan (new, growing, oversaturated).
Competitor Benchmarking Agent â†’ Gemini 1.5 Pro (models/gemini-1.5-pro-001)
Analyzes competitor videos from the past 7-14 days.
Predicts trend adaptability based on remix potential.
Output: Trend category, lifespan, adaptability score.

Step 1.2: Psychological & Emotional Appeal (20%)
Agents & Models:
Emotion Analysis Agent â†’ Gemini 1.5 Flash (models/gemini-1.5-flash-002)
Identifies primary emotion (e.g., humor, suspense, nostalgia).
Assigns emotional intensity score (0-10).
Engagement Predictor Agent â†’ Gemini 1.5 Pro (models/gemini-1.5-pro-002)
Detects psychological hooks (Curiosity Gap, FOMO, Social Proof).
Predicts likelihood of comments, shares, reactions.
Output: Emotional appeal rating, engagement potential.

Step 1.3: Hook & Retention Power (20%)
Agents & Models:
Retention Analysis Agent â†’ Gemini 1.5 Flash (models/gemini-1.5-flash-8b-001)
Evaluates first 3 seconds hook strength (0-10).
Detects pattern disrupts for attention retention.
Drop-Off Prediction Agent â†’ Gemini 1.5 Pro (models/gemini-1.5-pro)
Predicts mid-video exit points using engagement modeling.
Evaluates ending strength (rewatchability, share triggers).
Output: Hook effectiveness, retention score, expected drop-off points.

Step 1.4: Uniqueness & Shareability (15%)
Agents & Models:
Uniqueness Scoring Agent â†’ Text Embedding Model (models/text-embedding-004)
Compares against existing viral content to assign Originality Score (0-10).
Social Shareability Agent â†’ Gemini 1.5 Flash (models/gemini-1.5-flash-002)
Predicts whether the video encourages duets, remixes, discussions.
Output: Uniqueness score, engagement predictors.
